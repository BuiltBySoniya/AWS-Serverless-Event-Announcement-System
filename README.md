# AWS-Serverless-Event-Announcement-System
Built a serverless event announcement website that lets users subscribe via email, view events, and create new events. The frontend is hosted on S3, while API Gateway, Lambda, and SNS handle subscriptions, event creation, JSON updates, and notification delivery end-to-end.
